# Zigzag Animation
This Python script creates a simple text animation of asterisks (********) that appears to "bounce" left and right across the console screen. It does this by printing the asterisks with increasing and then decreasing indentation (spaces before the stars), creating a back-and-forth motion until the script is interrupted.
