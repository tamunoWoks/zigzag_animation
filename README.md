# Zigzag Animation
This Python script creates a simple text animation of asterisks (********) that appears to "bounce" left and right across the console screen. It does this by printing the asterisks with increasing and then decreasing indentation (spaces before the stars), creating a back-and-forth motion until the script is interrupted.

## Features
- The animation continues in a loop until you stop it manually (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C).
- The time.sleep(0.1) line controls the speed of the animation.
- The try/except block ensures the program exits cleanly when interrupted.
